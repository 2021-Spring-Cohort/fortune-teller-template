### Part 3

Display the user's fortune in this format:

    *[First Name]* *[Last Name]* will retire in *[# of years]* with *[bank balance]* in the bank,
    a vacation home in *[location]*, and travel by *[mode of transportation]*.

Your program should be able to process input whether a user enters capital or lowercase letters.

## Stretch Tasks (Optional)

- [ ] Give the user the ability to quit the program by typing "Quit" (should not be case sensitive) at any point where the program is looking for user input. The program should print “Nobody likes a quitter...” before ending. - _Tip_: To do this with the prompts that expect an integer, you will need to read in a `String`, check for "Quit", then _"parse the string to an int"_ (google it!) to convert the user input string to an `int`.
- [ ] Research `while` or `do/while` loops and use them to check whether a user typed "Help" for favorite color, printing the list of colors each time the user types "Help".

      	```bash
      	What is your favorite ROYGBIV color?
      	Help
      	The ROYGBIV colors are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet.
      	Help
      	The ROYGBIV colors are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet.
      	Blue
      	```
